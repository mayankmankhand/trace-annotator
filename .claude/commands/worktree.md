# Create a Parallel Worktree

Set up an isolated worktree so you can work on a feature in a separate Cursor window without affecting your main working copy.

**Use this when:** You want to work on multiple features in parallel, or isolate experimental work from your main branch.
**Don't use this when:** You're doing a quick fix or documentation update on main.

<rules>

- Do NOT rollback or undo any steps if something fails partway through. Report the failure and move on. Attempting to undo a partially created worktree can leave git in a tangled state.
- Do NOT read the contents of `.env.local` - it contains API keys. Use the shell `cp` command to copy it.
- This command takes no arguments. Worktree names are auto-generated. The branch gets a meaningful name later when `/explore` identifies an issue.

</rules>

## Procedure

<procedure>

### Step 1: Guards

Run these checks. If any fail, stop with the indicated message.

1. **Git repo check** - Run `git rev-parse --git-dir`. If it fails, stop: "This isn't a git repository. Navigate to your project root and try again."
2. **Not already a worktree** - Compare `git rev-parse --git-dir` with `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`. These return the git directory for this working copy vs. the shared git directory for the whole repo. If they differ, you're in a worktree. Stop: "You're already in a worktree. Run this command from your main project folder instead."
3. **Not detached HEAD** - Run `git symbolic-ref HEAD`. If it fails, stop: "You're in detached HEAD state. Check out a branch first with `git checkout main`."
4. **Uncommitted changes warning** - Run `git status --porcelain`. If there is output, warn: "You have uncommitted changes. They won't appear in the new worktree - only committed code is copied." Do NOT stop - just inform the user.

### Step 2: Setup

1. Run `git worktree prune` to clean up stale entries.
2. Run `mkdir -p .claude/worktrees` to ensure the directory exists.

### Step 3: Find the next number

1. Parse `git worktree list` output and scan `.claude/worktrees/` for existing folders.
2. Look for folders matching the pattern `worktree-N` (simple numeric only - ignore issue-named folders like `worktree-58-branch-conflicts`).
3. Find the highest N and use N+1. If none exist, start at 1.

### Step 4: Create the worktree

Run: `git worktree add -b worktree-N .claude/worktrees/worktree-N HEAD`

If it fails because the branch name is taken, increment N and try again.

### Step 5: Install dependencies

If `package.json` exists in the worktree root, run: `npm install --prefix .claude/worktrees/worktree-N`

If there is no `package.json`, skip this step. If npm install fails, warn the user but do NOT stop. The worktree is still usable for non-debate work.

### Step 6: Copy environment

Copy `.env.local` from the main repo root into the worktree root:
`cp .env.local .claude/worktrees/worktree-N/.env.local`

- If `.env.local` does not exist in the main repo, skip and note it.
- If it already exists in the worktree, skip (don't overwrite).

### Step 7: Print summary

</procedure>

<reference>

Print a clear summary using this format:

```
Worktree ready!

  Path:    /full/absolute/path/to/.claude/worktrees/worktree-N
  Branch:  worktree-N
  npm:     installed (or: failed - run manually / skipped - no package.json)
  .env:    copied (or: skipped - not found / already exists)

Next steps:
  1. Open that path in a new Cursor window
  2. Use /explore to start working on your issue
     (/explore will rename the branch once an issue is identified)
  3. When done, run /document to create a PR and clean up
```
